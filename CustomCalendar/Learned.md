## Date
### **Date is a specific point in time, independent of any calendar or time zone.** It follows the Unix timestamp, which describes a date in the form of a time interval that has elapsed since the Unix epoch (an arbitrary date) (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970).
### The key takes away here is Date is a specific point in time, independent of any calendar or time zone.
